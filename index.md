# Vision
Build a knowledge-exchange platform for all technology lovers.

# Mission
Provide an opportunity to gain and share knowledge among software technology enthusiasts in the Rajkot.

## About Us
We are a group of people who have successfully arranged various Laravel related Meetups in the Rajkot for the last one year. After all these Meetups we felt that technology Meetups can’t be restricted to one single technology. There should be no boundaries in technologies as technology is just a tool that can help to solve any real-world problem. We have come to an idea of this Rajkot.Tech

## How will it work?
We will take interest from developers of Rajkot and do Meetups accordingly. For now, we have done all Meetups around the Laravel ecosystem, now if we come to know developers love to arrange Meetups for python and we have speakers for the same, it will happen the next time. There will be no restriction on the technology as far as enough developers are ready to make it happen.

Rajkot.tech will provide an opportunity to arrange Meetups on various technologies in a single platform.

## How can you contribute to Rajkot.tech?
